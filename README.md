### How to watch the website?
1. Clone this repository and open in VS Code
2. In Terminal: npm install 
3. Move to folder json-server in your Terminal window and type this line:  json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000
    -	This should start up a server at port number 3001 on your machine. The data from this server can be accessed by typing the following addresses into your browser address bar:
        + http://localhost:3001/dishes
        + http://localhost:3001/promotions
        + http://localhost:3001/leaders
        + http://localhost:3001/feedback
    -	The json-server also provides a static web server. Any resources that you put in a folder named public in the json-server folder above, will be served by the server at the following address:
      http://localhost:3001/
    -	Shut down the server by typing ctrl-C in the terminal window.
 4. In Terminal: npm start . Then let's discover!
